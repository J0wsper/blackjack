Hi! This is just a simple little blackjack simulator I'm coding up. It is very much in-progress and so it isn't actually playable yet but hopefully it'll get there soon.
It uses Node.js to run the server and Socket.io to communicate to the server. The simulator also has limited chat functionality, betting and so on.
